Hey there, you snazzy lil' rapscallion! 

You've caught me adventuring in the little-known, but wonderous, kingdom of Clojure where riveting side-quests continue to keep me quite busy; there's always a dragon to tame, the village folk are friendly, and I'm having a lot of fun!

Here, take this potion of endurance :baby_bottle:, and until we meet again, farewell!

May your courage be `immutable` and your intellect `functional`!
